# Prefab System

### Why:

`com.unity.entities 1.0` introduced a baking workflow. This created a need for a new way to identify baked entity prefabs without costly search schemes and dozens of one-off tags.

I expect this repo to become obsolete in 3-18 months once `com.unity.entities` introduces more refined and tested workflow + API to do this.

### What:

Package that implements a simple way to lookup entity prefabs. Lookup is burst-compiled.

# Example
- Create in your sub-scene a `GameObject` with `Prefab System/Prefab Pool Authoring` component and fill it's `Prefabs` field with prefabs you want to register.
- Alternatively use `Prefab System/Prefab Authoring` component to bake and turn any `GameObject` in your sub-scene into a registered prefab.
- Write your game code and refer to these prefabs like this:
```csharp
var prefabs = SystemAPI.GetSingleton<PrefabSystem.Prefabs>();

// prefabs.Dependency contains JobHandle to queue read/write access to prefabs.Lookup
prefabs.Dependency.Complete();// call before accessing prefabs or set as dependency

Entity prefab = prefabs.Lookup["prefab name"];
```
> NOTE: GameObject prefab name will become it's unique prefab id
